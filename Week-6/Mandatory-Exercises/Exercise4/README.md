# Blog App

## Objectives

This project was built to:
- Understand the **need and benefits** of component lifecycle in React.
- Identify various **lifecycle hook methods**.
- Implement `componentDidMount()` to load external data.
- Handle UI rendering errors gracefully using `componentDidCatch()`.
- Render a list of blog posts fetched from an API.

```
`Posts` Component
- `constructor`: Initializes state with empty posts.
- `loadPosts()`: Fetches data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.
- `componentDidMount()`: Triggers API call after mounting.
- `componentDidCatch()`: Catches any render-time errors.
- `render()`: Maps post data to HTML using `<h2>` and `<p>`.
